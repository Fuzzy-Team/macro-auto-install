# How to install Fuzzy Macro

To do so, open Terminal and paste this command:

Command:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzzy-Team/macro-auto-install/refs/heads/main/install_macro.command)"
```

This installer has been tested and works on Macos 26.2 M4 chip.

In theory it should work with:

Macos 10.12+
All Mx chips
All Macs with an intel chip and Macos 10.12+
